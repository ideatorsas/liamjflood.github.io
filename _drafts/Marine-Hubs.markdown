Driving time from Drammen to 

Trains are a potential competitor but careful placement and segmentation of users can override

By opening habour flexibility you might open up the Uber of the seas.

### The Shipping Agent
Increased flexibility without the need for complex navigation at the final stages.
Able to skip the queue.
