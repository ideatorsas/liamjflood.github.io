A Black Swan is an event that no one predicted. It comes from the idea that if you only observe white swans. when someone asks you what colour swans are you say white. Similarly the weight of turkey increases daily, almost predictably; until it is Christmas. Taleb argues that a Black Swan cannot be predicted using the formal models, based on Gaussian methodologies, that have been used in the past.

Taleb finds so much randomness in the world that predicting the future in any meaningful way is almost impossible. However this randomness some times has little impact because the very acts of randomness cancels out other acts of randomness and therefore the situation becomes stable. He would call such a place medicrostan. This is just one of his scenarios.

He identifies two base scenarios that he calls medicrostan (areas that are not scalable) and extremistan (areas that are scalable). The first task is to identifying which of these situations you are in. In our increasingly networked world the chance that you are in a scaleable situation is increasing. For an example just think of any business that has the chance to explode; basically every start up in Silicon Valley and increasingly everywhere else! In such a business Gaussian distributions do not work as models to predict the future.

How then do we plan in extemistan(?); our stakeholders demand it! During my studies I have looked in detail at scenario planning and how it could can help in Black Swan conditions because the extremes (situations in extremistan) can be registered. It doesn’t mean that the extremes are identified but you are better prepared for the extremes of a stable business; either yours or a competitor’s. It provides the opportunity to broaden the discussion and thereby having the opportunity to pick up on areas that might turn into Black Swans. Even this discussion of exposing a potential black swan turns it grey according to Taleb; it lessens the impact.

This is where we can help.
