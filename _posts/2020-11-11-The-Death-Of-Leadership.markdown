# Definitions

To open this essay it is necessary to discuss some definitions these are discussed further in another essay. The first is digital and the associated concepts of digitization, digitalization and digital transformation. Digitization is the simple the process of converting something from analogue to digital. Digitalization is the process of interacting with this new content. Finally digital transformation is the strategic realization and leveraging of the interactivity with digital content. This essay will use the third definition, digital transformation as a focus.

The other definition is leadership. Traditional definitions include descriptions of the “great man” and how to emulate them. This is particularly apparent in the work of Carlyle. However the idea of leadership as an empty concept is emerging and this was one that we Gamayuns like and can associate with.

The reason for our appreciation is that it means that leadership roles are no longer the preserve of “great men”. It means that you do not have to emulate dead, mainly white, middle aged men; although some of us Gamayuns certainly fit a number of these catagories! It means that you don’t have to be rich or from a privileged background to learn how to be a leader. It means that the idea of being a “born leader” is absolute rubbish.

However it is clear that there are leaders and that leaders are generally useful to have. They provide guidance, possibly mentoring; they are able to communicate their vision to inspire others. The qualities listed are not able to be pinned down. They are vague and this is where the title of the essay is possibly fulfilled.

# But…….

However individuals are able to have an abstract concept as a leader. When a leader expresses their vision their followers do not follow the leader but they follow the vision that the leader sets out. There are numerous examples of this from deities to royalty to the nation-state.

The very definition of leadership then is elusive, with leaders being just the personification of the abstract concept of leadership with either power given to them by another body.

Henry V by Shakespeare written in 1599 is a favorite example. It should be noted that the speech was fabricated by Shakespeare, perhaps with the help of various historical sources, but it is unlikely that these words were spoken before the Battle of Agincourt in 1415.

The entirely fabricated Shakespearean speech of Henry V, whose character evokes the relatively abstract concept of a nation state as his inspiration.

The character of Henry V also uses the idea of empathy when he speaks about his “band of brothers”. He directly associates himself with the “vilest”, or lowest man, and call him his “brother”. It then follows that the study of leadership could avoid ambiguity by reframing to study of communication. The ideas above certainly suggest that leaders inspire through use of evocative language, often poetry, and empathy for those who they lead.

# So What?!

What is it about this use of language that creates abstract concepts that people can follow. This is what the theorist Weick argues for in talking about “evocative hunches”; despite the complex use of language which defies poetry. The following quotation stands as particularly opaque but once read maybe 100 times become clearer: “crucial to the performance of change management is the conversion of the experience of perceptual flux into evocative conceptual hunches as well as activities that reverse this conversion”.

Even as a native English speaker it was extremely difficult to break down and understand. However the learning, directly from the text, was that reframing is a key tool for a leader. Very often we are able to take a lot of academic concepts and talk about them with colleagues but they are often unable to digest or see them as too remote from what they are doing. Reframing is key, maybe Weick should try it!

The job of a leader then becomes the process of inspiring other others through evocative communication and empathy. Arnulf says that “the most important task is not to make decisions, but to make the situation meaningful”. This is exactly why is it possible for individuals to follow, often with great sincerity, an abstract concept. Therefore the real definition is around communication and how to communicate effectively and with credibility.

This is supported in texts about the quality of communication with leader-member exchange (LMX). Credibility can be influenced by two things: the quality of the interactions performed; the quality of the decisions made. These statements are supported in a number of articles and the first point is endorsed in the literature and goes further to show “the quality of the relationship between employees and their manager in combination with the nature and the frequency of their interpersonal interactions are important factors for employee well-being.”

What then do leaders need for effective communication? We were intrigued by the ideas around “competence v comprehension” because it requires leaders to be able to communicate concepts competently that may not be fully in their comprehension. However I also believe that it could be reversed to “comprehension without competence”. Leaders do not require competence of a subject; they simply require comprehension and then must rely on their followers to provide the competence.

# Let’s get to the point

In the context of the digital transformation a new leadership capability is not required; just the ability to negotiate and communicate through, even more abstract concepts and ideas than before. A good example is the previous course in machine learning. It taught us to understand the concepts without necessarily understanding all the details; it gave us enough to communicate with the experts. I think this is vital in the digital economy. We, as future leaders must understand what is possible but not necessarily exactly how to do it; comprehension without competence.

If the digital transformation does not really require a new skill of a leader the way that teams are formed around that leader has the potential to change significantly. The absolute competence in a series of complex and changing ideas, such as the potential of AI, by an individual or a fixed team is impossible. Leading in the digital age bring vast amounts of information and signals to detect and potentially act on.

This is maybe where a broader vision that gives room to maneuver to accommodate new technologies creates a leader who is more successful. But to do this it is necessary to know where you are going. This use of a broad vision can be seen in Tesla under Elon Musk. This too fits with the ideas of Drucker: “the best way to predict the future is to create it”. If you view the idea of “the great man” in this light it means that rather than predicting the future the idea is reversed. In hindsight it appears that the great man predicted the future; he did not, he created it.

With the digital transformation, there is the opportunity to get the best people from across the world and work remotely. The problem is that these specialists will be in high demand across industries and likely to be independent of larger corporations. Leaders then need to be able form specialist teams for specific roles quickly to take advantage of certain situations. Communication is going to be key with remote teams. This makes the communication of ideas and the ability to use the digital media effectively is key (video, podcasts, twitter, cloud etc).

One way to view a leader’s role in this context is through the lens of a network model where leaders form an organization purely as a network that connects a diverse number of stakeholders (employees, clients, investors etc). While this is not a novel idea, previous examples are cooperatives that were established in the UK at the same time as the industrial revolution, the key difference in the digital transformation is that these stakeholders can be efficiently drawn from anywhere in the world. The digital transformation massively increases the possible network that a leader can draw on, often at very short notice.

With this increasingly flexible way of working, particularly remotely, the traditional structures of top down management need to change radically. Just the distance, particularly with time-zone differences, combined with cross cultural differences, creates a network where none of these can be effectively controlled in the traditional sense. It there for requires leader to interact with teams, as discussed above, with communication of a vision that provides direction and allows stakeholders to carry out tasks quite independently.

This also means that further different metrics will also be needed to judge effectiveness, especially if building a platform, such as VIPPs where success may not be monetary initially but will be judged in the number of connections made that may be monetized later. EBITDA is a very normal tool to measure overall operational effectiveness but by measuring effectiveness at a lower level could add a lot of value. Facebook is a key example of this, referencing user statistics in it’s annual report because the size of the network provides future opportunities for monetization.

If the tools available for this communication are effectively used then information sharing potential maximized leading crowdsourcing of ideas and to emergent strategies. This make digital transformation a great platform not only for the exploitation of the current business, because of the level of expertise that can be accessed in the network but also make exploration easier, again because of the diverse network and individuals in it. There are huge opportunities for pretotyping, see the work by Savoia.

Digital is certainly the ultimate adaptive space however as was demonstrated at the theatre so is the physical stage. People go back again and again, in some cases to see the same play to get that feeling again of immersion, of entering a different world. This is what digital cannot presently replace, even though it is an open book there is a limit to how much can be taken from a flat screen; immersive and augmented reality could change this.

However advances such as this are accepted with a certain nervousness of digital where clearly there could be advantages without destroying the values and ethos of a company or place. This is going to be key for leaders; the ability to reframe digital tools in a less scary way. The digital transformation isn’t all about robots taking your jobs. It is about giving you more time to think and reflect and therefore do a better job without having to be a computation machine for massive databases. The digital transformation, if enabled properly, allows us to focus on what is important to us; it allows us to be more human.

Finally, we have the opportunity with the digital transformation to radically alter how we live and work. We need to focus on what the benefits are to the individual; helping them do what they love and using digital to provide time for it.
