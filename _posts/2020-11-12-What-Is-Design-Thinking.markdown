I like to explain the process of the design thinking by re-telling the first encounter I had with it.

We were set a brief of designing a “healthcare product for digital natives”. As a group we all jumped to conclusions about how we could create the best running app with loads of smart add ons that all the major comanpanies had missed.

We were then shown this:
image for design thinking

This picture was extremely confusing but by forcing ourselves to follow the steps (with some iterations; hence the loops backs) we developed something completely different that what we expected.

First we broke the problem down with our team and tried to understand the different elements. Who was a digital native? What was their perception of health? What was meant by a product?

Once we had worked out that a digital native was someone of an age who had never lived without the internet being present we interviewed them about what their answers were to the second and third question we asked.

It turns out that the individuals we interviewed that represented the digital native group were not concerned with their physical health. They thought they had good control over that and were aware of how to look after themselves through healthy eating, exercise and so on.

What was surprising was that the majority of them said that it was their mental health that worried them and that in this digital age physical connections were something that they needed.

With this information we developed a point of view which we solved for.

The point is that if we had solved the first problem statement we would not have had a worthwhile product. Only by working through the steps in the diagram above were we able to understand exactly what our target group wanted and then develop a product for them.

So in short, reject the initial problem statement; find out who can tell you what the real issue is and then solve for that.
