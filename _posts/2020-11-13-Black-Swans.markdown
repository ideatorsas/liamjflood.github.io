## Introduction

Blockchain is an increasingly important technology in society. Most people know about it’s links with currencies such as Bitcoin but it is so much more than that.

It is a tool that can help build trust among in a supply chain or in a market where there is little knowledge of who else is participating. The artistic industries have a lot to gain from using such technologies as more and more of their output is digital. This issue with producing digitally is that it is very easy for producers to lose control of it and therefore not get the royalties that are associated with their hard work.

The combination of blockchain and smart contracts can help.

## Blockchain

Blockchain is a “distributed database of records or public ledger of all transactions or digital events that have been executed and shared among participating parties” (Crosby et al, 2018). It is distinct from operators using blockchain technology such as BitCoin and specifically distinct from smart contracts. These are discussed below.

Blockchain was introduced as a concept by Nakamoto (2008) as an integral part of bitcoin where it serves as the public ledger recording all transactions on the cryptocurrency network. The basic principle of blockchain methodology is that the distributed ledger acts in the same way as a witness to a contract would; because of the large number of witnesses in the network it is difficult for anyone to create a false entry in the ledger.

## Smart Contracts

Smart contracts are contracts that operate as a layer on top of a blockchain. They enable transactions between untrusted parties. Specifically “smart contracts [are] self-executing agreements based on blockchain technology which have the capacity to create trust in what is termed no-trust contracting environments” (Eenmaa-Dimitrieva and Schmidt-Kessen, 2019).

For example smart contracts have been suggested as a solution to royalty payments in the music industry. Each digital track would have a smart contract enabled within it so that when the file is played a payment is made in a digital currency by the listener to the distributor, license holder, artist and other stakeholders in the correct proportions immediately (O’Dair et al. 2016). This shows how blockchain adds to the efficiency of the market by enabling cash flow and reducing administrative costs.

Another example is in the healthcare industry where blockchain and smart contracts are used, in combination with medical sensors, connected to the network, to trigger certain services or send notifications to relevant parties. This system is non-monetary but facilitates more secure communications. This is especially important if patients are not in hospital and being treated and monitored at home. Without blockchain and smart contracts data would have to be sent insecurely and could be disrupted (Griggs et al, 2018). This is a clear example of the data security and continuity benefits of using blockchain and smart contracts.
