# Ecosystem Strategy For Humnitarian Organisations

## Introduction

There has been much written about open innovation and enablement of busines ecosystems. These have been led by Chesborough[^f1] in his analysis of Xerox, Kodak and others. The argument is that many of the previous household names of the industrial past are no longer with use because they kept to the concept of closed innovation. That is "if you want something doing right you had better do it yourself". 



## The Problem

This lead us to the problem. Can the non-pofit or charitable sector learn from the same examples?

Nesta[^f2] points to a number of areas that are more unique ot the non-profit buiness model: 

*Breaking down internal siloes
*Focusing innovation investment on core business concerns such as increasing giving
*Taking well managed risks and not being afraid to be seen to 'fail'
*Developing a culture that embraces testing of 'imperfect' ideas as a way of developing ones that will work
