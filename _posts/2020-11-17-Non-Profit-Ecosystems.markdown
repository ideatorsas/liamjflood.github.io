## Introduction

There has been much written about open innovation and enablement of busines ecosystems. These have been led by Chesborough[^f1] in his analysis of Xerox, Kodak and others. The argument is that many of the previous household names of the industrial past are no longer with use because they kept to the concept of closed innovation. That is "if you want something doing right you had better do it yourself". 

Innovation is not just about changing a product is about the business model and delivery model. 

Creating and executing new methods ideas and programs for making needed change.

Charles Lee Innvation is just problem solving by removing pain or adding value. 

## The Problem

This lead us to the problem. Non profit leaders and practiioners tend not to think their organisations are innovative [^f8]. This is becasue there is no time or budget to innovate. Similar to the operational business environment there is such a high focus on the day to day. This leads to inefficeincy and a maybe value being lost. 

Can the non-pofit or charitable sector learn from the same examples?

Nesta[^f2] points to a number of areas that are more unique ot the non-profit buiness model: 

* Breaking down internal siloes
* Focusing innovation investment on core business concerns such as increasing giving
* Taking well managed risks and not being afraid to be seen to 'fail'
* Developing a culture that embraces testing of 'imperfect' ideas as a way of developing ones that will work

These are common problems and not unique to a non-profit. 

There are two lenses to consider:

  The perspective of the non-profit
  the perspective of the partners

## The Non-Profit Perspective

There is a need to do more with less. This is consistent with observations from accross industry. As the world bcomes more complex there is a need for more and more specialists. There becomes a point when it is impossible for organisition to have all that specialism in house and it has to be oursourced in some way. Open innovation is one way of outsourcing. 

As referenced by Nesta this creates a number of issues within the organsation. 


## The Partner Perspective

Holmes and Smart[^f3] examine this perspective and they find three key areas that define the success of a cooperation: 

* associations between previous experience of corporate–NPO engagements, the ﬁrm’s stakeholder focus and the resulting innovation

* the function of engagement scope and scope development in shaping innovation outcomes

* the role of the main corporate boundary spanner



## Implications

Because this is written through the lens of how should a non-profit operate the implications are focused there. 

Holmes and Smart[^f3] idenify two approached to innovation from the partners. They observed and emergent process and a more predetermined search with a specific focus in mind. 

For the emergent process, similar to emergent strategy as defined by Mintzberg [^f4], this is where partners continue to collborate enabling feedback loops to develop. An example of this is Norway is the Kongsberge technology hub or the statrt up scene in Oslo. 

Over time reliance on the expertise of others in the value configuration will and the encouragmnent of giving feedback will improve the product or serivce.

Everyone has be given the authority to innovate. 

There needs to be a move away from centralisation. This is juxtaposed against a need to be resposible for funding. Is there an ethical viewpoint here? Not really because it is the same as the responsibility towards shareholders. 

With the specific process this may be more suited to shorter term projects or partners with a specific skill to contribute. 



For boundary spanning roles the links between the organsations are important. 


This lead to a 2 by 2 grid that can show strategies for how to operate in each of therse scenarios:

Emergent / Specific
Strong links / Weak links


As noted above the 

Emergent and strong links is natural
Partners working closely at multiple levels. 


also 
Speific and weak links. 
Normal project management. 


This is reflected in the business world. 

Specific projects with strong links may lead to creep
A strong project lead will need to be in place. 

Weak links with emergent may lead to innovation being lost. 
In this case a strong facilitator is needed that can document the processes on both sides. 


Why would corporate partners be willing to have a long term relationship with a non profit? For ESG purposes? 

Sustainability is key and helping to grow their own markets.
