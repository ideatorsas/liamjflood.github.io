## Introduction

There has been much written about open innovation and enablement of business ecosystems. These have been led by Chesborough[^f1] in his analysis of Xerox, Kodak and others. The argument is that many of the household names of the industrial past are no longer with use because they kept to the concept of closed innovation. That is "if you want something doing right you had better do it yourself". 

Chesborough argues that by opening the process of innovation organsations are able to draw on expertise from other areas to improve their product or service.

But what is innovation? Innovation is not just about changing a product is can also be about the business model and delivery model. It is creating and executing new methods ideas and programs for making needed change. 

And to put it in the context of the humanitarian non-profit the Standford Center for Social Innovation [^f2] defines it as "a break from practice that leads to positive social impact".  

## The Problem

This lead us to the problem. Non profit leaders and practitioners tend not to think their organisations are innovative [^f3]. This is becasue there is no time or budget to innovate. Similar to the operational business environment there is such a high focus on the day to day. This leads to inefficeincy and a maybe value being lost. 

Can the non-pofit or charitable sector learn from the same examples?

Nesta[^f4], an innovation foundation working on big challenges facing society, points to a number of areas that are common to the non-profit buiness model: 

* Breaking down internal siloes
* Focusing innovation investment on core business concerns such as increasing giving
* Taking well managed risks and not being afraid to be seen to 'fail'
* Developing a culture that embraces testing of 'imperfect' ideas as a way of developing ones that will work

These are common problems and not unique to a non-profit. 

There are two lenses to consider: the perspective of the non-profit; the perspective of the partners

## The Non-Profit Perspective

There is a need to do more with less. This is consistent with observations from across industry. As the world bcomes more complex there is a need for more and more specialists. There becomes a point when it is impossible for organisition to have all that specialism in house and it has to be oursourced in some way. Open innovation is one way of outsourcing. 

Specifcally for aid to refugee the UNHCR reports that there was a funding gap in 2018 of 45% and this is likelyy to increase as "donor funding [falls] increasingly behind as the number of forcibly displaced worldwide has grown"[^f5]. 

As referenced by Nesta this creates a number of issues within the organsation. 


## The Partner Perspective

Holmes and Smart[^f6] examine this perspective and they find three key areas that define the success of a cooperation: 

* associations between previous experience of corporate–NPO engagements, the ﬁrm’s stakeholder focus and the resulting innovation

* the function of engagement scope and scope development in shaping innovation outcomes

* the role of the main corporate boundary spanner



## Implications

Because this is written through the lens of how should a non-profit operate the implications are focused there. 

Holmes and Smart[^f6] idenify two approached to innovation from the partners. They observed and emergent process and a more predetermined search with a specific focus in mind. 

For the emergent process, similar to emergent strategy as defined by Mintzberg [^f7], this is where partners continue to collborate enabling feedback loops to develop. An example of this is Norway is the Kongsberge technology hub or the statrt up scene in Oslo. 

Over time reliance on the expertise of others in the value configuration will and the encouragmnent of giving feedback will improve the product or serivce.

Everyone has be given the authority to innovate. 

There needs to be a move away from centralisation. This is juxtaposed against a need to be resposible for funding. Is there an ethical viewpoint here? Not really because it is the same as the responsibility towards shareholders. 

With the specific process this may be more suited to shorter term projects or partners with a specific skill to contribute. 


For boundary spanning roles the links between the organsations are important. 


This lead to a 2 by 2 grid that can show strategies for how to operate in each of therse scenarios:

|            |   Emergent |  Specifc | 
| |||
| Strong Links	 |    Partners working closely and fluidly at multiple levels.  |   |
| Weak Links	 |     |  "Normal" project management  |


This is reflected in the business world. 

Specific projects with strong links may lead to creep
A strong project lead will need to be in place. 

Weak links with emergent may lead to innovation being lost. 
In this case a strong facilitator is needed that can document the processes on both sides. 

## Actions

Identify what mode the partner organisations are in using the table above and whether this is appropriate. 

Map functions where expertise is needed. 

Make sure there is a budget for time money and space to innovate. 

Set the ethos internally by asking for feedback and allowing others to fail. 

Work on the long term stuff. 

## Conclusion

There are major similarities between the normal cirporate environment and the non-profit sector. The same trends apply and similar methods can be used.

Start up general model:
1 market oportunity
2 business model
3 business evolution and growth

main problem is that non profit jumps step 2

High donar focus without focus on the end user. 

The funding models used mean that the roadmap is set out without room for pivots.
