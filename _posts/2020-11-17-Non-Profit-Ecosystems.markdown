# Ecosystem Strategy For Non-Profit Organisations

## Introduction

There has been much written about open innovation and enablement of busines ecosystems. These have been led by Chesborough[^f1] in his analysis of Xerox, Kodak and others. The argument is that many of the previous household names of the industrial past are no longer with use because they kept to the concept of closed innovation. That is "if you want something doing right you had better do it yourself". 



## The Problem

This lead us to the problem. Can the non-pofit or charitable sector learn from the same examples?

Nesta[^f2] points to a number of areas that are more unique ot the non-profit buiness model: 

* Breaking down internal siloes
* Focusing innovation investment on core business concerns such as increasing giving
* Taking well managed risks and not being afraid to be seen to 'fail'
* Developing a culture that embraces testing of 'imperfect' ideas as a way of developing ones that will work

These are common problems and not unique to a non-profit. 

There are two lenses to consider:

  The perspective of the non-profit
  the perspective of the partners

## The Non-Profit Perspective

There is a need to do more with less. This is consistent with observations from accross industry. As the world bcomes more complex there is a need for more and more specialists. There becomes a point when it is impossible for organisition to have all that specialism in house and it has to be oursourced in some way. Open innovation is one way of outsourcing. 

As referenced by Nesta this creates a number of issues within the organsation. 


## The Partner Perspective

Holmes and Smart[^f3] examine this perspective and they find three key areas that define the success of a cooperation: 

* associations between previous experience of corporate–NPO engagements, the ﬁrm’s stakeholder focus and the resulting innovation

* the function of engagement scope and scope development in shaping innovation outcomes

* the role of the main corporate boundary spanner
