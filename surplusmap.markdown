In renewables there is excess energy when the wind blows a little too much, the sun shines a little too hard or there is too much rain. In most cases the energy producers can generate the power but the gid cannot trasnport it. This is called curtailment. 

This is where SurplusMap comes in. They enable the co-location of energy producers and those that can use it to reduce curtailment.
